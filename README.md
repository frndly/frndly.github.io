#   My   Portfolio   Site

This is a simple single page portfolio that I made for freeCodeCamps introductory course.  
The site has been broken for a very long time, but I hope to have it complete and the Lipsum replaced with real content soon.

I created all graphics on the page using Sketch, and it is coded solely in HTML and CSS.
